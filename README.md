This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template to use when reporting a [bug in the Next.js repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues) with the `app/` directory.

## Background

This is mostly a clone of https://github.com/vercel/nextgram because it was easy to demonstrate the issue using it's setup, but it uses the bug repo template as base. All-in-all, there should not be much code that can affect this bug despite there being more codde than there needs to be.

I took the components, related styles and data from https://github.com/vercel/nextgram with the only modification being all of the pages and layouts are inside a `(group)` folder.
